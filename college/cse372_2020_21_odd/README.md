**Background**
The paper is based on Cyberphysical Social Systems (CPSS). It proposes a general approach using genetic algorithm to solve problems in the aforementioned topic.

**Present Work**
An approach to solve the floorplanning problem is developed using vanilla genetic algorithm. It was proved to be effective. 

**Future Work**
Implementation of Multistep Simulated Annealing algorithm
