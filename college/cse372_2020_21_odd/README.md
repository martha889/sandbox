**Background:**
The paper is based on Cyberphysical Social Systems (CPSS). It proposes a general approach using genetic algorithm to solve problems in the aforementioned topic.

**Present Work:**
An approach to solve the floorplanning problem is developed using genetic algorithm. It was proved to be effective. Then multiprocessing was used to reduce the running time. 

**Future Work:**
Implementation of Multistep Simulated Annealing algorithm
